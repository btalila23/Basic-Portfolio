            <p>My name is Talila Burka. I have a background in healthcare and communication. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a bachelors degree in Communication.
            </p>
            <p>Technology has always intrigued me and all the possibilities it comes with. I joined the U of M Coding Bootcamp to widen my skillset and dip my toes in something I know we as a society will need in the future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I enjoy exercising, spending time with family, and playing video games. Traveling is also a passion of mine, in the picture on the left I am in Istanbuly,Turkey.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My goal for the future is to further strengthen my knowledge of the primary computer languages and retain a good paying job with my experience.</p>
